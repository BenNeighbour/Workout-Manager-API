## About the project

<b>All code snippets and code references on this document are for the Workout Manager API. To see the Frontend code snippets and documentation, please visit the README in that repository, <a href="https://github.com/BenNeighbour/Workout-Manager-React/blob/master/README.md">Click Here to see that.</a></b>

This project; Workout Manager is my very first End-to-End Fullstack Web Application. I have been working on and using both React (a Javascript-based Library for Frontend Web Development) and Spring Boot (a Java-based Framework for Backend and Server-Side API & Web Development). Although I have been familiar with The Spring Stack/Java for the past 6 months, I have only just started to pick up Frontend Development...

Through this project, I have also gained skills of working with the fundamentals of Spring MVC and Thymeleaf (a HTML Template Engine). These were used in the 'Change Password' and 'Email' sector of the backend for various reasons which I explain later in another section of this README.

The database I have chosen for this project is MySQL (which again I have been fairly familiar with for the past 6 months). This is because despite the recent development and new use of NoSQL and JSON-based Databases, I am (at this point) using a relational one like Postgres or any of the SQLs. This has worked very nicely so far with the Hibernate ORM and JPA, therefor I do not plan on switching unless the others offer good support for Spring, and a good reason to choose it over my current stack.

## Getting Started

In order to get this to work on your machine, you will need to have Java 1.8 or higher installed and configured correctly. As well as this, you may need to install a Tomcat Server, but most modern Java IDEs have virtual, built-in Tomcats that are started when running.

This is a Maven-based project so if you are not using an IDE that can run the correct targets for any of the operations that Maven supports, you will need The Maven CLI as well.
